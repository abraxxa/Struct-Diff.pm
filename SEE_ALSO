    Looks abandoned =(
    Different diff representation: all-leveled marks (types looks redundant)

Also may be useful:
http://search.cpan.org/~zenspider/Struct-Compare-1.0.1/Compare.pm
    Recursive comparator, boolean.
http://search.cpan.org/~yves/Test-Struct-0.01/lib/Test/Struct.pm
    Almost the same as Struct-Compare, but with Test specific warns/errors.
http://search.cpan.org/~typester/Array-Diff-0.07/lib/Array/Diff.pm
    Arrays only, wrapper around Algorithm::Diff.
http://search.cpan.org/~davecross/Array-Compare-2.11/lib/Array/Compare.pm
    Turn both arrays into strings by join and compare result strings using eq.
http://search.cpan.org/~tyemq/Algorithm-Diff-1.1903/lib/Algorithm/Diff.pm
    Powerful, but for lists and texts (LCS as the corner point).
